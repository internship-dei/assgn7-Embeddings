And, truly, it can be really hard to find time for soccer practice \", \"and\", \" dance team rehearsals when you also have homework, part-time jobs, and, you know, a social life. They can be demanding, time-consuming hobbies, and maybe that\\\\u2019s a big reason why we see jocks and artsy kids living on opposite sides of the spectrum in the first place.\", \"Though they may not seem like essential parts of preparing for college, playing sports and participating in artistic endeavors cultivate distinct, very different strengths. And you develop skills not just useful on a college application but well into your adult life. So don\\\\u2019t be afraid to pursue your interests in either, and if you can make time for them both, then do both! It\\\\u2019s in your best interest to try.\", \"Here on the CollegeXpress staff, we happen to have two such high school archetypes: a drama geek and a multi-sport athlete. We decided to discuss our own experiences in arts and athletics, and the skills they cultivate. (Now, if only we could combine our brains, we\\\\u2019d have the perfect well-rounded student!)\", \"One of my earliest memories of playing sports was when I was about five years old in one of those funny little kid soccer games. To paint the picture for you, I was the one on the field picking daffodils as the ball passed by me. I admit, it wasn\\\\u2019t my most stellar moment as an athlete, but it was where it all started.\", \"They always say that practice makes perfect, and I couldn\\\\u2019t agree more. Being an athlete is all about being better each day, building upon what you did well (or not so well) in that last game. I actually had a coach who would write each player a note after games and tell us what needed work the next time we hit the field. My response to her critique was setting up drills in my backyard on the weekends and working even harder during practice to focus on those problem areas. I do my best to never make the same mistake twice. However, that first mistake is always a catalyst to accomplishing more and being better.\", \"As an athlete, you have to have thick skin to receive criticism if you didn\\\\u2019t make that one play or let that goal sneak by you. Outside of athletics and in the business world, I\\\\u2019m appreciative to have had that experience early on, as I was conditioned to know that a critique is a means of someone telling you that they know you can do better. When I started working in the CollegeXpress scholarship database, my manager will would always push to have a few more awards added or a few more edited than what I had initially done. Today, we are close to 20,000 (awesome, I might add) scholarships and it was because I was pushed beyond my comfort zone.\", \"The skill of time management has become synonymous with the student-athlete. With daily practices after school, games, and group bonding outings, to do well in school on top of each of those is like walking a tight rope, juggling five classes, homework, tests, and even a (small) social life. I was once told that there are no excuses to not be able to do the work you have chosen to take on; you have to keep your hands in different pots and always be stirring. Deadlines need to be met, communication with clients needs to be taken care of, and general tasks need to be completed, somehow while a billion other things are going on.\", \"I\\\\u2019ll admit it: I\\\\u2019m not the most social person you\\\\u2019ll ever meet. However, being on a team requires communication. Much like being on the field, every employee is in a position they excel at to propel a company forward. As you yell to let a teammate know you\\\\u2019re there to receive a pass, you let your coworkers know when you need help or to simply keep them up-to-date on what you\\\\u2019re doing so they in turn can complete what they need to. Without good communication and teamwork, the whole thing breaks down. But with it? You become unbeatable.\", \"My grandmother took me to see my first performance, a ballet called \", \"Copelia\", \", when I was eight years old. I was already a pretty dramatic child, and after seeing that show, I wanted to be on stage pretty much from that moment on. Of course, I had all the grace and coordination of a stuck pig, so ballet was out. But I loved singing and acting, and was a choir geek/theater nerd to the core. Not so surprisingly, I also enjoyed other creative pursuits, like writing, painting, and craftwork. That\\\\u2019s why I\\\\u2019m so thankful I get to delve into many of these interests, writing and planning unique, creative (I hope!) content for our magazines and websites.\", \"Chiefly among the skills fostered by the arts is, of course, creativity. That same ability that helps you see the sculpture in a pile of clay also fosters an ability to look at problems from new and innovative angles. Out in the \\\\u201creal world,\\\\u201d if an idea isn\\\\u2019t really working for you (or not working for whomever you\\\\u2019re reporting to), you can tap into your creative instincts to try things a different way. In my own life, when I\\\\u2019m developing the articles you read on CollegeXpress and in our magazines, I often need to cover similar topics year after year: campus visits, financial aid, etc.\\\\u2014it\\\\u2019s just the nature of the college search cycle. But I try to approach these topics in new ways, so our readers can benefit from our site, whether it\\\\u2019s their first visit or their 50\", \"th\", \".\", \"Besides the creativity inherent in the arts, you can also develop stronger interpersonal and professional skills. For example, the experience of performing in a live show can help prepare you for future public speaking engagements\\\\u2014even if that\\\\u2019s just speaking up in a company meeting. Head up, shoulders back, say what you need to say! You also get accustomed to rehearsing what you have to say, a handy skill when it comes to preparing for job interview questions.\", \"What about the visual arts? Communicating your emotions through a work of art is pretty different from sharing your opinion in a boardroom, right? Well, there\\\\u2019s more straightforward communication to the arts than you might think. It\\\\u2019s actually pretty rare for artists to \", \"avoid\", \" discussing their work. They might write artists\\\\u2019 statements or brief descriptions of their work, and they may simply discuss their techniques at length in an academic setting. My soon-to-be sister-in-law is an absurdly talented ceramic artist, and as an artist-in-residence, she has given lectures and even had people watch her throughout the day\\\\u2014reality TV style\\\\u2014as she creates and talks about her work! Needless to say, she knows how to talk to a room and to clearly express herself. \\\\u00a0\", \"You might not think there are many similarities between the two, but artists and athletes do share several foundational skills. And they\\\\u2019re skills from which you undoubtedly benefit as a college student and a working professional in any field.\", \"You develop time management skills that come from juggling a busy schedule, whether it\\\\u2019s fitting in football practice or rehearsals for the spring musical. You gain confidence, whether it comes after displaying a painting in a competition or scoring a goal. Both are competitive fields, whether you\\\\u2019re gunning for the All-State team or the All-State choir. Time management and organizational skills? A confident, positive outlook? A healthy sense of competition and ambition? These things are hiring managers\\\\u2019 dream qualifications.\\\\u00a0\", \"And, if we might get a little sentimental for a minute, you can\\\\u2019t discount the pure joy you get from doing something you love. Life is tough sometimes, and personal happiness takes work. Engaging in these activities, artistic or sporty, even just for fun, can make for an all-around happier you. And that\\\\u2019s worth the time and effort alone.\", \"TL;DR: Arts vs. athletics? Nah, more like arts + athletics. Getting involved with either (and, if you can, both!) is sure to help you in your college and career goals.\", \"Join the CollegeXpress community!

The University Health System (UHS) of San Antonio, one of those spaces, was implemented when UHS built a sky tower as part of its University Hospital expansion and renovation.\", \"As part of the planning process, Perkins+Will officials met with the employees who would use the space, particularly nurses and nursing leadership and technical staff, Williams says. As a nurse and a Lean Black Belt, she gathered information about best practices around the country to inform the design of the discharge lounge. \\\\u201cDischarge lounges have been around for years,\\\\u201d she says. \\\\u201cHowever, they haven\\\\u2019t always been utilized appropriately, and it was mainly through the staffing.\\\\u201d\", \"A typical problem is relying upon volunteers to staff the discharge lounge. If the volunteers don\\\\u2019t show up, the discharge lounge can\\\\u2019t provide necessary services to patients. Instead, Perkins+Will recommends adequate staffing.\", \"In recent years, hospitals have experienced shortages of beds in the ER or in main wards, and so patients back up in the ER, complicating their care, Williams says. Post-surgery patients may be feeling good and ready to be transferred to a bed, but with a shortage of beds, what are hospitals to do?\", \"\\\\u201cOne of the things that they were trying to do is look at ways that they could empty out the beds upstairs, so that they aren\\\\u2019t having these delays in turnaround time for getting patients upstairs in a bed,\\\\u201d Williams says. \\\\u201cOne of the ways that can be done is through discharge lounges.\\\\u201d\", \"UHS did the discharge lounge right, Williams says. \\\\u201cThey have it staffed appropriately, which is great, and they have really nice Barcaloungers for the patients to be discharged, because not everybody that\\\\u2019s discharged is still feeling absolutely wonderful.\\\\u201d\", \"Other amenities in the lounge include oxygen, since so many discharged patients go home on oxygen. Patients can also wait at the lounge for the arrival of durable medical equipment. Hospital officials say UHS is considering opening up a second lounge for additional capacity given the success of its existing lounge, Williams says.\", \"Discharge lounges also serve as a gathering point for patients waiting for rides, as well as for family members waiting for patients, further relieving the chaos of having discharged patients scattered throughout the hospital, she says.\", \"UHS\\\\u2019 lounge also includes a kiosk where patients can receive their medications at the time of discharge. \\\\u201cThey can even talk to the pharmacist about their medications, if need be,\\\\u201d Williams says. In an \", \"April 2017 study\", \" by the journal \", \"Patient Preference and Adherence,\", \" patients with low and intermediate medication adherence had an adjusted 2.54-fold higher odds of readmission compared to patients with high adherence.\", \"As former director of a large trauma center, Williams knows well the pain of having an overloaded ER. \\\\u201cAt one time I had 43 admissions waiting for beds upstairs,\\\\u201d she says. \\\\u201cIf you do that, you have locked down your ER, not being able to turn your regular ER patients through. Same thing with the operating room. If your recovery area is totally booked because you can\\\\u2019t place these patients, it affects your surgeries. So it is a big issue in a lot of hospitals, and the discharge lounges seem to be working if they are staffed appropriately.\\\\u201d\", \"The comfortable seating in a post-discharge center can also be a much better patient experience for those waiting to be seen in the ER. \\\\u201cWhen I worked in the emergency room, the one thing that drove me crazy was to see someone on an ER stretcher for eight hours,\\\\u201d Williams says. \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s a hard stretcher, so lots of times we would try to even get a hospital bed down that we could put them on, if we knew that they were admitted.\\\\u201d Still, the goal, particularly on the part of nurses, is always to open up the beds upstairs\\\\u2014hence the encouragement of prompt check-out, moving patients to the post-discharge center.\", \"UHS is monitoring this churn time as one way of evaluating the effectiveness of its discharge lounge, Williams says.\", \"In addition, care transitions have been identified as a heavy influence on readmission rates. As described in the \", \"October 2016 \", \"PSQH\", \" story\", \", \\\\u201cExploring Post-Discharge Spaces Designed to Eliminate Gaps in Care,\\\\u201d more health systems are looking at creating spaces that let discharged patients easily access the information and resources they need while they\\\\u2019re still at the hospital or near their clinical team.\", \"Deciding how to appropriately staff a post-discharge center depends upon the size of the lounge and the needs of the patients who will be using it, Williams says. \\\\u201cMany patients that are being put in discharge lounges are healthy or they\\\\u2019re getting better, but then there are some patients that have chronic conditions and are going to be discharged home but need some kind of support,\\\\u201d she says. \\\\u201cThose patients may need a little bit more looking over or care for, but usually there\\\\u2019s space for a family member to be in the lounge too to help them out, because they basically have been discharged from the hospital.\\\\u201d\", \"Minimum staffing for a post-discharge center generally includes a nurse or two acting as dedicated post-discharge coaches, plus one or two tech staffers, Williams says. The nurses can also answer questions about medications the discharged patients may be receiving from the kiosk, although at UHS, the kiosk can also connect patients directly to pharmacists via two-way video conferencing.\", \"Some hospitals have experimented with recommending that patients \\\\u201ccheck out\\\\u201d for discharge by noon, much like a hotel, in order to help prepare that bed for a new patient, but having a discharge lounge can make it more likely patients will follow those recommendations, Williams says. \\\\u201cThey\\\\u2019re just trying to be able to have something that staff could then utilize to move these patients down once they\\\\u2019re discharged and then to make that bed ready for the next patient,\\\\u201d she says.\", \"\\\\u201cMondays are one of the worst days in hospitals, especially emergency rooms,\\\\u201d Williams continues. \\\\u201cThey\\\\u2019re one of the busiest days, because people have waited. Maybe they\\\\u2019ve been sick all weekend, and waited until their family doctor opens up. They can\\\\u2019t get appointments, so they end up coming to the emergency room or whatever, and then that\\\\u2019s one of your highest admission days.\\\\u201d\", \"Another potential use for discharge lounges is to accommodate discharged patients affiliated with nursing homes, Williams says. \\\\u201cMany times they\\\\u2019ll get transported to the hospital a few hours early before whatever procedure they\\\\u2019re going to have, and then they wait and then they get the procedure, and then they have to wait a few more hours for rides back. They could be placed in one of these spaces while they wait.\\\\u201d\", \"As the move to improve patient experience and outcomes continues, expect post-discharge facilities to continue to find a role to play.\", \"Scott Mace is a contributing writer to \", \"PSQH.\", \"Be the Expert!
